\subsection{Systematic uncertainties}

\tk{TODO:
Treat here how the scale variations are used, and explain the procedure to implement the bin-to-bin correlations in the likelihood.

The theoretical predictions described in Section~\ref{sec:theory} are subject to theoretical uncertainties from the renormalisation scale $\muR$ and the factorisation scale $\muF$.
% 
The standard approach to evaluate the impact of these uncertainties is to compute an envelope of scale variations, and to assign the extrema of the envelope as the uncertainty.
% 
To this end, $\muR$ and $\muF$ are independently varied between $0.5$, $1$, and $2$ times their nominal value, whereas the fraction $\frac{\muR}{\muF}$ is constrained not to be less than $0.5$ or greater than $2.0$.
% 
As the theoretical spectra in the $\kappat$/$\cg$/$\kappab$ case and the $\kappac$/$\kappab$ case contain a resummation, the uncertainty in the resummation scale $Q$ is also considered, and it is evaluated by varying $Q$ from $0.5$ to $2$ times its central value (while keeping $\muF$ and $\muR$ at their respective central values).
% 
The theoretical uncertainties are assigned by applying the minimum and maximum scale variations per bin.
% 
The resulting uncertainties for the spectra under variations of $\kappab$ and $\kappac$ and variations of $\kappat$, $\cg$, and $\kappab$ are shown in Table~\ref{tab:TheoryUncertainties_kappab_kappac} and \ref{tab:TheoryUncertainties_kappat_kappag}, respectively.

Theoretical uncertainties are subject to bin-to-bin correlations.
% 
We adopt a procedure that produces a correlation coefficient $\rho_{ab}$ directly from the individual scale variations:
% 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ab} = 
\frac{
    \sum_i ( \sigma_{a, i} - \overline{\sigma}_a ) ( \sigma_{b, i} - \overline{\sigma}_b )
    }{
    \sqrt{
        \sum_i ( \sigma_{a, i} - \overline{\sigma}_a )^2
        \sum_i ( \sigma_{b, i} - \overline{\sigma}_b )^2
        }
    }
    \,,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
% 
where $\sigma_{a (b), i}$ is the cross section in bin $a$ ($b$) of the $i^\text{th}$ scale variation, $\overline{\sigma}_{a (b)}$ is the mean cross section in bin $a$ ($b$), and $\rho_{ab}$ is the resulting correlation coefficient between bin $a$ and $b$.
% 
The correlation structure is characterized by strong correlations among bins at moderate transverse momentum ($15 \leq \pth \leq 600\GeV$).
% 
Only the bins with $\pth<15$ and $\pth>600$\GeV are anti-correlated with the bins at moderate transverse momentum.

The correlation matrices obtained from this procedure are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scalecorrelationmatrices}.
% 
In both cases the low $\pth$-region is less correlated with other bins than the other bins among one another.
% 
This is mostly due to the resummation that has a large impact on the low $\pth$-region.
% 
In the case of $\kappat$/$\cg$ variations, the overflow bin is less correlated as well.

\subsubsection{Dependence of the correlation matrix on the couplings}

The procedure described in Sec.~\ref{sec:correlationmatrixprocedure} neglects the effect of coupling variations on the correlation matrix.
% 
In order to estimate the impact of this effect, the correlation matrices in Sec.~\ref{sec:correlationmatrixresults} are computed at different values of the couplings $\kappa_b$ and $\kappa_c$, using only the gluon-induced contributions (because only of only these variations, the theorists supplied the scale variations per coupling variation).
% 
The minimum and maximum of every entry in all correlation matrices are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:CorrelationMatrix_minmaxStudy}.
% 
A cross-check performed in Sec.~\ref{sec:theoryuncertaintycrosschecks} reveals that large differences in the correlation matrix lead to relatively minor differences in the final fit results.
% 
Therefore, the correlation matrix at SM coupling values is considered the nominal correlation matrix to be used for all future results.

% Branching fractions

\subsubsection{Branching fractions}

The branching ratios are subject to uncertainties stemming from the input parameters ($\alpha_s$, $m_b$, $m_c$ and $m_t$) and theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher order contributions.
% 
The theoretical uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, whereas the parametric uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated.
% 
Uncertainties on the partial widths are taken from Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.
% 
Figure~\ref{fig:scans_kappatkappag_brcomparison} shows the $\kappa_b$/$\kappa_c$ with branching ratios fixed to their SM expectation, with and without the uncertainties on the branching ratios.
% 
The difference is clearly negligibly small, and as such the uncertainties on the branching ratios are neglected in further results.
