Differential Higgs boson ($\hboson$) production cross sections are sensitive probes for physics beyond the standard model.
% 
New physics may contribute in the gluon-gluon fusion loop, the dominant Higgs boson production mechanism at the LHC, and manifest itself through deviations from the expected standard model distributions.
% 
% Combined spectra from the $\PH\to\cPgg\cPgg$, $\PH\to\cPZ\cPZ$ and $\PH\to\bbbar$ decay channels are presented, together with limits on the Higgs boson couplings and a combined inclusive Higgs boson production cross section measurement using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}=13$\TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv.

Spectra for the $\hgg$, $\hzztofourl$, and $\hbb$ decay channels, using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}=13$\TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv, are presented.
% 
The spectra are combined to place limits on the Higgs boson couplings to the top, bottom, and charm quarks, as well as a direct coupling to the gluon field, and to measure the inclusive Higgs boson production cross section.
% 
The measured total cross section is $61.1   \pm 6.0 \,\text{(stat)}   \pm 3.7 \,\text{(syst)} \,$pb, and the precision of the measurement of the differential cross section of the Higgs boson transverse momentum is improved by about 15\%.
