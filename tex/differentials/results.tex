\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:diffxs-results}

While technically not a differential cross section, a measurement of the total Higgs boson production cross section is achieved without much further effort by considering the input analyses in only a single bin at both reconstruction and generator level.
% 
The total cross section for Higgs boson production is measured to be
$61.1   \pm 6.0 \,\text{(stat)}   \pm 3.7 \,\text{(syst)}  $\pb
, based on a combination of the $\hgg$ and $\hzz$ channels.
% 
The measured total cross sections from the individual channels are $64.0\pm9.6$\pb for $\hgg$ and $58.2\pm9.8$\pb for $\hzz$.
% 
The likelihood scans for the individual decay channels and their combination are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RatioOfbrsAndTotalXSscan}~(left).
% 
The combined result agrees with the SM value of $55.6\pm2.5$\pb~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.


A measurement of the branching fraction for one decay channel is degenerate with a measurement of the total cross section.
% 
However, the ratio of branching fractions for two decay channels can be measured while profiling the total cross section.
% 
In order to parametrize the fit in terms of the ratio of the $\hgg$ and $\hzz$ branching fractions, $\BRgamgam/\BRZZ$ and $\BRgamgam$ are profiled in the fit, while $\BRZZ$ is parametrized as:
% 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\BRZZ = \frac{\BRgamgam}{ \left( \frac{\BRgamgam}{\BRZZ} \right) }
\,.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
% 
The likelihood scan for $\BRgamgam/\BRZZ$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RatioOfbrsAndTotalXSscan}~(right).
% 
The measured value of $\BRgamgam/\BRZZ$ is
$0.092   \pm 0.018 \,\text{(stat)}   \pm 0.010 \,\text{(syst)}  $,
which is in agreement with the SM prediction of $0.086 \pm 0.002$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

The differential cross section spectra, unfolded to the full phase space, are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CombinedSpectra_pth}, \ref{fig:CombinedSpectra_njets}, \ref{fig:CombinedSpectra_rapidity}, and \ref{fig:CombinedSpectra_ptjet} for the variables $\pth$, $\njets$, $\absy$, and $\ptjet$, respectively.
% 
Additionally, Fig.~\ref{fig:CombinedSpectra_pth} (right) shows the $\pth$ spectrum for Higgs bosons produced exclusively through $\ggh$, which is obtained by assuming the SM normalizations for the non-$\ggh$ production modes and associating an uncertainty with them.
% 
The numerical values of the spectra can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:tables}.
% 
Some spectra contain an overflow bin, for which there is no clear bin width by which to normalize; in these cases, the normalization is chosen to be the bin width of the preceding bin.
% 
For all spectra, the statistical uncertainty dominates the systematic uncertainty.
% 
No significant deviations from the SM are observed.
% 
The $\pth$ spectrum, the most important spectrum for interpretation at the current levels of integrated luminosity, has uncertainties ranging from about $25$ to $40\%$.
% 
Compared to the spectrum of the $\hgg$ channel individually, this amounts to an improvement in the precision of about $15\%$.
% 
The contribution of the $\hbb$ channel to the overall precision of the combination is most significant in the last $\pth$ bin; while the improvement is seemingly not large, the reduced uncertainty in the tail has a measurable impact on the interpretations in Section~\ref{sec:interpretation-results-ktcgkb}.
% 
An important piece of information when interpreting differential cross sections is the corresponding bin-to-bin correlation matrix; these are given for each kinematic variable in Appendix~\ref{sec:binToBinCorrelationMatrices}.
