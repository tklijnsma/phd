\section{Measurement of differential Higgs boson production cross sections}
\label{sec:diffxs}

\emph{%
This section describes the combination procedure of the differential Higgs boson production cross sections for the $\hgg$, $\hzz$, and $\hbb$ decay channels, and the corresponding results. The text, illustrations, results and conclusions closely follow the original documentation, which can be found in Refs.~\cite{AN-17-244,HIG-17-028}. First the statistical procedure to obtain a (combined) cross section measurement is described, followed by a discussion of the systematic uncertainties and a discussion of the results obtained.
