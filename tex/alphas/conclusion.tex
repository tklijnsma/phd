\subsection{Conclusions}
% 
We have used seven measurements of the top-antitop quark production cross section
at the LHC and the Tevatron in order to determine the strong coupling constant $\asmz$,
using the CT14 PDF set and the NNPDF30\_nolhc PDF set at NNLO and NNLO+NNLL.
% 
Overall, our determination of $\as$ yields a value that is compatible
with the world average value and uncertainties that are somewhat larger
than the best individual determinations, though comparable to that
from the electroweak precision data~\cite{Baak:2014ora}.
%
The largest uncertainties are associated with unknown higher-order
contributions and PDF uncertainties.
