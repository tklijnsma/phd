\subsection{Results and discussion}


The combination procedure is performed for each of the two PDF sets
taken into consideration at NNLO and at NNLO+NNLL separately. The
combination results and their unweighted average are displayed
numerically in Table~\ref{tab:combinationresults}, and graphically in
Fig.~\ref{fig:unweightedaverage}.

There is no unique way to quote a final best estimate of $\as$ based
on the results obtained from the different PDF sets and QCD
calculation choices (NNLO v.\ NNLO+NNLL).
%
An unbiased approach for combining results from different PDFs, in
line with the PDF4LHC recommendations~\cite{PDF4LHC}, is to average
without applying any further weighting.
%
In accordance with that approach we take the straight average of the mean
values and the uncertainties of the individual combinations.
%
This coincides with the procedure for combining $\as$ results from a
single class of observables in Ref.~\cite{PDG}.
%
The final result is
\begin{equation}
\asmz =
    \alphasResultCenter
    \; {}^{\highersub{$+\alphasResultRightError${}}}_{\lowersub{$-\alphasResultLeftError${} }}
\end{equation}
%
which can be compared to the result of Ref.~\cite{CMS-ttbar-alphas},
$\as(m_Z) = 0.1151^{+0.0028}_{-0.0027}$.
%
Our central value is larger mainly because recent measurements of the
cross sections are higher than that used in
Ref.~\cite{CMS-ttbar-alphas}, but also in part because of our choice
to take the average of results from NNLO and NNLO+NNLL cross sections
(a $0.6\%$ increase relative to just NNLO+NNLL).
%
Our symmetrised uncertainty of $\alphasResultSymmPercentage\%$ is
somewhat increased with respect to that of
Ref.~\cite{CMS-ttbar-alphas}, $2.4\%$ (symmetrised).
%
The difference in uncertainty is due to several choices.
%
On one hand we have taken a smaller uncertainty on the top-quark mass,
in line with the PDG determination.
%
One the other hand, we have been somewhat more conservative in our
treatment of theoretical and PDF uncertainties.
%
Firstly, the choice of treating the scale uncertainties on $\stt$ as a
$68\%$ confidence interval instead of a (flat) $100\%$ confidence
interval increases the scale uncertainty component by roughly a factor
of $\sqrt{3}$.
%
Secondly, we have used an average of the uncertainties from NNLO and
NNLO+NNLL cross section determinations, which also yields a larger
uncertainty than using NNLO+NNLL cross section determinations only.
%
Finally, the PDF sets used for the determination were chosen with
minimization of potential biases in mind, rather than the ones with
smallest uncertainty.
