This section covers the Large Hadron Collider and the CMS detector.

\subsection{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the largest particle accelerator with the highest center-of-mass energy to date.
% 
It is the final stage in a series of accelerators which are part of the CERN accelerator complex, which is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:cernacceleratorcomplex}.
% 
The LHC is built partially in Switzerland and in France, and it is located about 100\unit{m} underground.
% 
Its design corresponds to a \textit{storage ring}, in which particles are kept in a circular trajectory for an extended period of time using powerful superconducting magnets.
% 
The achievable center-of-mass energy for proton-proton collisions, the primary research mode for the LHC, depends on the magnetic field strength of these 1232 bending magnets (about 8.3\unit{T}~\cite{lhc}) and the radius of the ring (about 27\unit{km}).
% 
The latest data from the LHC, including the data used in this thesis, was collected at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$.
% 
The LHC employs 16 radiofrequency (RF) cavities in order to create tight particle bunches and to accelerate particles from the insertion energy of about 450\GeV to 6.5\TeV.

Of the many detectors associated with the CERN accelerator complex, the four most prominent ones are the CMS detector, the ATLAS detector, the LHCb detector, and the ALICE detector.
% 
The CMS and ATLAS detectors are both general-purpose detectors, with a similar physics program meant to yield comparable measurements.
% 
This thesis concerns data from the CMS experiment, and the structure of its detector is treated in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:cmsdetector}.


For any particle physics process, the rate of events $\mathrm{d}R/\mathrm{d}t$ is given by
% 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}R}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sigma \, L_\text{inst}
\,,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
% 
where $\sigma$ is the cross section of the process and $L_\text{inst}$ is the instantaneous luminosity.
% 
For a given center-of-mass energy, $\sigma$ is a constant; the instantaneous luminosity, however, is a machine quantity that is to be optimized in the design of an accelerator.
% 
For two colliding beams containing an equal number of particles $N$ that are Gaussian-distributed in the plane perpendicular to the direction of motion with a beam width $\sigma_\text{beam}$, the instantaneous luminosity is given by~\cite{griffiths}
% 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
L_\text{inst} =
\frac{
    N^2 f N_b 
    }{
    4 \pi \sigma_\text{beam}^2
    }
\,,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
% 
where $f$ is the revolution frequency and $N_b$ is the number of bunches.
% 
The \textit{integrated luminosity} $L$ is given by the integral of the instantaneous luminosity over time and is typically expressed in units of \fbinv.
% 
It is the typical quantity employed for indicating the size of a collection of data.


At the time of writing, the LHC has just finished its second data-taking run, colloquially referred to as `Run 2'.
% 
Combined with the first data-taking run, the LHC has delivered almost 200\fbinv, and is expected to deliver around 300\fbinv by the end of the third data-taking run.
% 
The evolution of the delivered luminosity and the collected luminosity by the CMS detector is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmslumi}.

\subsection{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:cmsdetector}

As a general-purpose detector, the CMS detector was designed to be able to detect most SM particles over a large range of energy scales.
% 
The cylindrical shape, with the beam axis at its center, provides a nearly complete solid angle coverage, up to a pseudo-rapidity of $\eta \leq 3.0$.
% 
The components of the detector are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmsgeometry}; starting from the beam axis, the first detector is the silicon tracker, followed by the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and the hadron calorimeter (HCAL).
% 
These detectors are enclosed in the superconducting solenoid magnet, which delivers a magnetic field strength of 3.8\unit{T}, is cooled with liquid helium, and is the largest superconducting solenoid to date.
% 
With its 14000 tonnes and its length of 28.7\unit{m}, `Compact Muon Solenoid' seems to be a misnomer at first glance, but for the range of detector applications it provides, the CMS detector can in fact be considered relatively compact.
% 
Of the stable SM particles listed in Section~\ref{sec:sm}, the CMS detector detects electrons, photons, stable hadrons, and muons; the typical trajectories of these particles are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmsslice}.
% 
A full description of the CMS detector can be found in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.

\subsubsection{The inner tracking system}

The inner tracking system, consisting of a pixel detector surrounded by a silicon strips detector, measures the trajectories of charged particles and reconstructs secondary vertices.
% 
It is designed once again designed cylindrically, with a length of 5.8\unit{m} and a diameter of 2.5\unit{m}, and is able to perform measurements up to $\abs{\eta} \leq 2.5$.
% 
As high radiation levels are part of the operating environment, the tracker is designed to be radiation hard.
%
An important design parameter of the inner tracker is the material budget, which directly affects the achievable resolution of the other subdetector systems; the complete inner tracker corresponds to 0.4 radiation lengths in the central region, and increases up to almost 2 radiation lengths in the forward regions~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.
% 
The trajectory is precisely measured with 11 to 17 trajectory points, which requires 66 million pixels and 91 million strips in the pixel and strips detectors, respectively.
% 
The inner tracker is the most important subsystem for low-energy particles; for single muons up to 100\GeV and $\abs{\eta} \leq 1.6$, the \pt resolution is around 1-2\%.


\subsubsection{The electromagnetic calorimeter}

The electromagnetic calorimeter, starting at an inner radius of 1.3\unit{m}, is responsible for the energy measurement of charged particles, and is in particular important for the high-precision measurement of the energy of photons and electrons.
% 
It consists of 61200 lead-tungstate crystals in the barrel region, which have a length of 230\unit{mm} and correspond to 25.8 radiation lengths.
% 
Lead-tungstate crystals have a short scintillation time, are optically clear, and relatively radiation hard.
% 
The barrel region is organized into 36 \textit{supermodules}, each of which consists of 4 \textit{modules}.
% 
The modules further removed from the interaction point have their crystals tilted, so that the front face of the crystal is aimed towards the interaction point.
% 
The barrel covers the measurements up to $\abs{\eta} \leq 1.479$.
% 
The forward regions are covered by two endcaps approximately 3\unit{m} from the interaction point in the longitudinal direction, which extend up to $\abs{\eta} \leq 3.0$ and consist of 7324 identical crystals each.
% 
Also these crystals are slanted so that the small front face of the crystal points to the interaction point.
% 
The endcaps are prefaced by the 20\unit{cm} thick \textit{preshower}, whose primary purpose is the enhanced identification of neutral pions in the forward region.
% 
The preshower is a sampling calorimeter that consists of two layers, each containing a lead plate (which initiates electromagnetic showers) and a silicon strip sensor (which measures the deposited energy and the transverse shower profile).
